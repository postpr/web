<p>When <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">the COVID-19 pandemic</a> began, the longtime Apple volunteer started looking for
ways to keep helping others remotely<br>and discovered the organization, which anonymously
connects those in crisis to a volunteer who has been trained by professionals
to listen and offer support. Since joining in March 2020, Hazen has logged
more than 400 hours of texting as part of Apple’s <br>Employee Giving program;
Apple matches every hour an employee volunteers, or dollar they donate, with a
monetary donation to the same organization.</p>

<p>“It makes me so happy that Apple helps to magnify the time I put into
this,” says Hazen. “The money goes to such an amazing organization that is
meeting people where they are during a really difficult time.”</p>
